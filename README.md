# ICTV Resources

I often get asked questions about phage and virus taxonomy. I'll keep a record of the resources I create here. 

## Prokaryotic virus list
I have created a list of all the bacterial and archaeal taxa classified by ICTV. The information is extracted from the latest Master Species List which can be found on the ICTV website [(MSL)](https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/9601).  
The current version is MSL#35, approved during the EC51 meeting in Berlin, ratified by email vote March 2020.
